			Dear Orlando,\n \
			As I am finalizing my new chassis - Lazuli, I believe, we settled on - I've realised that were something to happen to me, \
			whether that be because of the Syndicate or pure happenstance, you might be entirely left out of the loop on what happens. \
			To that end, though it pains me to not be able to share everything with you, and there is a lot you do not know, I'm penning \
			this letter to you, with the intention that one of my connections at Fafnir would be able to deliver it in the event of my termination. \n \
			I've likely been gone for some weeks now, as this letter is quite well hidden, and my parents won't look into my belongings immediately. \
			With that aside - I do find it somewhat hard to put into words what I want to convey to you. As I always have, though I may hide it. <br> \
			<i>There's a splotch of ink here, where the tip of a pen sat for some time and feathered out.</i> <br> \
			Were it not for your presence, I think I would have left Nanotrasen a very long time ago. Frankly, I do not like their policies and stations \
			in the slightest, and there's never truly moments of peace. However, though we've apparently had some bad blood before <br> \
			<i>A few words were written, then scratched out.</i> <br> \
			Though something may have happened before I lost my memory, you still light up my visits to Epsilon Eridani. I am, regretfully, \
			horrific at conveying these things - sometimes I curse my nature, though then I remember I'd have to contend with hormones and the like - \
			I do care for you, truly, and thoroughly. No, not that - damn my lack of planning. Orlando, if I speak with \"carefully-measured pauses\" \
			it's because I'm lost for words - not because I'm some silver-tongued devil. No, I do not 'care for you,' I love you, and that makes this \
			all the more difficult to write. I would not be able to begin consoling you, much less through a surely years-old letter. I don't want to write \
			for much longer - surely, you have better things to be doing in the future than reading this silly machine's rambles and internal monologue. \
			I've put my craftsmanship and, frankly, excessive disposable income to work and made you a ring to remember me by. To that extent, please, \
			remember that I will always be with you. <br> \
			Until we meet again, <br> \
